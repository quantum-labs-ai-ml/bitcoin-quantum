Demo project about "breaking" bitcoin cryptography

Bitcoin's cryptography primarily relies on the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) using the secp256k1 curve and the SHA-256 hash function. "Breaking" Bitcoin's cryptography would typically mean finding a way to forge signatures (e.g., recovering a private key from a public key) or reversing SHA-256 to manipulate transactions. However, these are computationally infeasible with current technology due to the mathematical hardness of elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) and the collision resistance of SHA-256. For a demo project, we can simulate a simplified, intentionally weakened version of Bitcoin's cryptography to illustrate how it works and where vulnerabilities could theoretically arise if the parameters were weak.

This project will:

    Use Python to implement a toy elliptic curve cryptography system with a small key size (vulnerable to attacks).
    Demonstrate signing and verifying a transaction (mimicking Bitcoin's ECDSA).
    Show how a brute-force attack can recover the private key in this weakened system.
    Highlight why Bitcoin's real parameters (secp256k1) make such attacks infeasible.

Note: This is purely educational and uses a trivial curve for demonstration. Bitcoin's actual cryptography is secure due to its large key sizes and robust algorithms.

How can Grok help?

=== Bitcoin Cryptography Demo (Simplified) ===
Private key: 2
Public key: (6, 3)
Message: Send 1 BTC to Alice
Signature: (13, 3)
Signature valid: True

=== Simulating Brute-Force Attack ===
Attempting brute-force attack...
Private key found: 2
Signature with recovered key valid: True

Note: This demo uses a tiny curve (p=17, n=19). Bitcoin uses secp256k1 with a 256-bit key, making brute-force infeasible.
